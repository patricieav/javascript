    <h2 class="era"> My Past</h2>
    <p>
    Hello, My name is Patriciea, but generally I go by Trease.  I was born and raised in Dallas and 
    still reside in the County. I have been married for 12 years and my husband and I have an amazing daughter that
    is also part of a STEM school as well as a STEAM extracurricular program that encourages young women of color to explore
    the unlimited possibilites that are available to them. Shortly after graduating high school, I joined the U.S. Army 
    ("HOOOAHH"), where I was member of the Signal Corp as a 74C; telecommunications operator, also known as a 25D today. 
    This was my first exposure to building web pages and although it was part of my training, I didnt get to
    experience it as much as I would have liked. Most of my duties included working in a tactical vehicles during field training
    and exercises testing the transmission and receipt of messages.  After ending my tour in the Army, I entered the civilian
    world working with home loans and progressed to working with bankruptcy cases which is something that I have grown to love
    over the years.  Although it's a rewarding challenging career due to its accuracy and legal requirements, I didnt feel 
    as if I was exceling anymore and decided to go back to school.  With an interest in Cyber and Data Security, I wasnt 
    sure if it was right for me, but definitely wanted to take the first step torward changing my career.

    <h2 class="era"> My Present</h2>
    <p>
    After a couple of years of pursuing my degree, I realized that while taking my programming language class, that
    it was the class that I enjoyed the most.  Shortly after, my previous employer had an internal reskilling 
    program where I was selected to participate in and developer program.  After an intense 8 week training as a Full Stack developer,
    I felt defeated and confused. I was then placed on a team where I didnt feel like I was going to excel or grow.  To reinvent myself
     and kickstart my future career, I decided to take classes on my own and a slower pace to ensure that I could rely on me.  One of the things
    that I like about myself is that I dont mind learning new things and once I learn it, I become very powerful with my skills. I've been 
    learning about different philosophers and spiritualists and using some of their quotes and motivational speeches to help me keep me 
    forward and not give up. One particular philospher that I like is <a href="https://isha.sadhguru.org/us/en"><span>Sadghuru</span></a>.  He is an
    Indian philosopher that teaches a lot on inner workings and allowing life to take its natural course. 
    </p>

    
    <h2 class="era"> My Future</h2>
    <p>
    Part of my future plans are to get back in the field and conquer most programming languages. Although I feel confident with languages such 
    as SQL, I think learning how to build a webpage to showcase my skills and become more innovative and creative will help me land a job
    in an environment where I can excel and capitalize on things that I have learned in the past.  I hope to one day be able to build websites 
    for all types of clients from personal to professional. Since I really don't have a lot of experience working with HTML, CSS or Javascript,
    I hope to retain as much as I can while taking this course to put me on the right track for my future.  I believe we can achieve anything we 
    want if you put your mind to it.  Stay commited and YOU CAN DO IT!!!
