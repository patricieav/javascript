		<p>My name is Patriciea, but most people call me Trease.  I am married with an awesome husband and 12 year old daughter. I currently work in the home lending market auditing and balancing ledgers for bankruptcy cases.  I'm also a veteran of the Army Signal Corp where I worked with communication and security, also known as COMSEC.  Today, that MOS is known as Cyber/Defense Security and it's where I began my interest for technology and learning about programming languages.  </p>
		<p>In the past, I have played around with learning a little about html and css, but not enough to confidently build a webpage the way that I would like.  While taking this class, I hope to learn more about enhancing the visual and the interactive perspectives of creating a website.  I also would like to create a site that my family and I can use as part of our daily lives. </p>
